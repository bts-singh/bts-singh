## 🚀 About
Student at CDAC focused on VLSI and RTL design. Translate specifications into reliable RTL, improve verification quality, and work with EDA flows toward tapeout-ready designs.

- 🎓 Current role: Student at CDAC  
- 🔭 Interests: RTL design, verification, timing closure, design-for-test (DFT)  
- 🌱 Learning: advanced VLSI flows, system-level verification, physical design practices

---

## 🧰 Top Skills & Toolchains
- RTL / HDLs: Verilog · SystemVerilog  
- Verification: UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)  
- EDA Tools & Flows: Cadence tools · Synopsys tools  
- Design & Analysis: RTL design · Static Timing Analysis (STA) · Design for Test (DFT)

## 🔐 Private contributions & additional cards (how to enable)
Some cards can show private contributions or expanded data only when the stats service has access to a GitHub token. For a professional setup, deploy your own instance of the stats services and set a GitHub token securely:

1. Create a Personal Access Token (classic token) in GitHub:
   - URL: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Scopes recommended: no scopes required for public data. To allow counting private contributions, include `repo` scope (or `read:user` + `repo` as needed). Be conservative with scopes.
2. Deploy your own instance of `github-readme-stats` (or other services) to Vercel / Render / Fly:
   - Repo: https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats
   - In the deployment environment variables, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the token created in step 1.
   - Use the deployment URL for the image sources, e.g. `https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app/api?username=bts-singh&count_private=true&theme=dark`
3. Replace the image URLs in this README with your deployment URLs to avoid exposing the token publicly.
4. Never embed a raw token inside the README. Use the deployed service and environment variables.

Want help deploying these services (I can provide step-by-step Vercel instructions and the exact image URL lines to paste).

## ✅ Suggested repo files (copy/paste)
If ready to paste into GitHub, add these (examples):

- Add this README.md to the root of the profile repository (repo named exactly as the username: `bts-singh/bts-singh`).
- If enabling private stats via a deployed service, update the image URLs to:
  - GitHub stats: `https://<your-deploy-url>/api?username=bts-singh&show_icons=true&count_private=true&theme=default`
  - Top languages: `https://<your-deploy-url>/api/top-langs/?username=bts-singh&layout=compact&theme=default`

---

## 🧾 Final notes
- This README is kept professional and badge-rich while remaining readable.  
- If preferred: switch to a more minimal layout (remove trophies/streak/activity graph), or to a colorful theme (change `theme=` parameter for each card).  
- If private contributions are desired, say "Help me deploy private stats" and a step-by-step deployment + exact URL replacements will be provided.

Thanks for reading — feel free to ask for visual tweaks, theme choices, or help deploying the dynamic stats services.
